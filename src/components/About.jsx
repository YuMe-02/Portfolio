            I'm a developer and designer based in San Francisco, blending my passion for technology with creative problem-solving. My journey began unexpectedly when a teapot mishap damaged my Nintendo DS, leading my uncle to teach me circuit board repair. That moment sparked a fascination that evolved into a deep interest in robotics and computer science.

          <p>
            This curiosity led me to the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I combined hardware and software expertise to develop projects focused on sustainability and community safety. A standout achievement was SOL, my safety light project, which earned recognition in the Santa Cruz Launchpad competition and introduced me to entrepreneurship.

            Beyond tech, I’ve built a reputation as a freelance photographer and graphic designer, enhancing my approach to user experience and visual communication. When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me capturing moments through photography, powerlifting, or recreating dishes from my favorite restaurants – always bringing the same creativity and attention to detail.
