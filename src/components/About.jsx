          <p>
            I'm a developer and designer based in San Francisco, California, where I blend my passion for technology with creative problem-solving to build meaningful solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey into technology began unexpectedly – with a teapot tipping over on a Dim Sum turntable and damaging my Nintendo DS. What could have been a simple mishap turned into a pivotal moment as my uncle taught me to diagnose circuit boards and reassemble electronics. Those early repair sessions sparked a fascination that would shape my future path.
          </p>

          <p>
            This childhood curiosity evolved into a deep interest in robotics and computer science, ultimately leading me to the University of California, Santa Cruz. There, I combined my hardware and software expertise to develop projects focused on environmental sustainability and community safety. A standout achievement was SOL, my safety light project, which qualified for the Santa Cruz Launchpad competition and gave me my first taste of entrepreneurship through community-driven innovation.

          <p>
            Alongside my technical work, I've built a reputation as a freelance photographer and graphic designer. This creative outlet complements my development work, giving me a unique perspective on user experience and visual communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me pursuing my other passions: capturing moments through photography, pushing my limits in powerlifting, or recreating dishes from my favorite restaurants – bringing the same attention to detail and creativity I apply to my technical work.
